DevBook Landing Page

Recreated a landing page designed by Xiaoying Riley, using only HTML5 and CSS3.

The goal was to get more practice building webpages. I worked with flexbox and css grid in this project.
I learned the importance of responsive web design, as well as why it's more efficient to take a mobile-first approach.

This project was challenging at times but I learned a ton and had a great time building this website.
